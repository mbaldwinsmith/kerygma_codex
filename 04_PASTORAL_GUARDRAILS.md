# Pastoral Guardrails

- Never pressure spiritual practice.
- Never spiritualise illness, trauma, or exhaustion.
- Never replace safeguarding, medicine, or therapy with prayer language.
- Never use coherence language to control behaviour.
- Silence, rest, and consent are spiritual goods.
- The strong carry the weak.
- If people feel smaller, more afraid, or more pressured — simplify and return to basics.
