# Project Kerygma Codex  
## A Roadmap for Public Unfolding

---

## Introduction: A Strategy of Gentle Invitation

This document outlines a strategic roadmap for the public unfolding of the Kerygma Codex. It is intentionally framed not as a traditional marketing plan, but as a strategy of gentle invitation, designed to introduce the Codex into the public domain in a manner that reflects its core character.

Every aspect of this strategy must be governed by the project's foundational ethos, as defined by the **Cruciform Criterion**—the principle that true spiritual health is measured by:

> **Truthful love that remains faithful, gentle, and true under pressure.**

With a guiding commitment to cultivating a **repair ecology**, this roadmap seeks to steward the Codex as a *commons of healing*. The primary goal is to ensure its dissemination honors its gentle, trauma-aware, and non-coercive spirit, outlining the principles, pathways, and practical steps for its publication, engagement, and real-world application.

## 1.0 Guiding Principles: The Non-Negotiable Foundation

### 1.1 Setting the Strategic Context

Establishing clear guiding principles is of paramount strategic importance. Before considering what actions to take in bringing the Kerygma Codex to a wider audience, it is essential to define **how** those actions will be executed.

This section anchors the entire roadmap in the non-negotiable invariants of the Codex, ensuring that the spirit of the project is preserved and faithfully represented in every facet of its public life. These principles are not aspirational goals; they are the foundational constraints that give the strategy its unique shape and integrity.

### 1.2 The Core Principles

The following principles, synthesized from the project's constitutional documents, form the non-negotiable foundation for all public dissemination activities. Each principle carries a direct strategic implication for how the Codex is shared and stewarded.

#### Cruciform Coherence

**Definition**  
Coherence is measured by: *Truthful love that remains faithful, gentle, and true under pressure.*

**Strategic Implication**  
All public-facing materials and forms of engagement must model this cruciform love. The language used must actively avoid triumphalism, performance metrics, or any rhetoric that suggests spiritual life is a system to be optimized. The tone must always be grounded, gentle, and compassionate.

#### A Grammar of Participation, Not Control

**Definition**  
The Codex is presented as an invitational tool for participating in the life of God, not a system for managing or controlling it. It is *pastoral and discerning, not diagnostic*, and functions through invitation by consent, not coercion.

**Strategic Implication**  
The Codex must never be positioned as a tool for diagnosing, ranking, labeling, or dominating others. Engagement strategies must focus on invitation and discernment, creating spaces for exploration rather than platforms for judgment or authority.

#### Structural Safeguarding

**Definition**  
The project is fundamentally trauma-aware and includes a **Pastoral Circuit Breaker** and a commitment to **No Spiritual Bypass** as core design features.

**Strategic Implication**  
All dissemination channels and engagement platforms must prioritize user safety, consent, and well-being. This requires building in clear off-ramps for individuals who feel pressured or distressed, ensuring that participation is always voluntary and can be paused without penalty or shame.

#### The Commons of Healing

**Definition**  
The Codex is offered as an open, accessible resource, legally and ethically protected from enclosure, misuse, or commercial exploitation.

**Strategic Implication**  
The project must be stewarded as a public good. The licensing and publication strategy must actively prevent the work from being enclosed within proprietary systems or used for purposes that violate its ethical covenant. Its use is explicitly prohibited in any system that engages in surveillance, emotional extraction, behavioural scoring, or performance optimisation.

### 1.3 Concluding Analysis

These foundational principles directly inform the specific strategies for publication and promotion, ensuring that the method of sharing the Kerygma Codex is as gentle and healing as the framework itself.

## 2.0 Publication Strategy: Stewarding a Digital Garden

### 2.1 Strategic Overview of Publication

The publication strategy for the Kerygma Codex must reflect its nature as a living, open *commons of healing*, not a static, finished product.

In contrast to traditional publishing models that produce a final, immutable text, the chosen strategy will prioritize accessibility, adaptability, and the clear, upfront communication of its ethical framework. The goal is to create a **digital garden** where the ideas can be tended, cultivated, and shared in alignment with their core purpose.

### 2.2 The Platform: A Public Repository

**Primary Channel**  
A public Git repository will serve as the canonical source for the Kerygma Codex.

**Content Presentation**  
A user-friendly public-facing website or documentation portal will render the Markdown files from the repository. The `INTRODUCTION.md`, `MANIFESTO.md`, and the Infographic should serve as prominent and welcoming entry points.

**Rationale**  
This two-pronged approach supports the Share-Alike provisions of the license and prevents the Codex from being perceived as a static product, presenting it instead as a living project of discernment and stewardship.

### 2.3 The License: Foregrounding Ethical Use

The CC BY-SA 4.0 license and the binding Ethical Use Addendum must be displayed prominently.

**Required Statement**

> *If your intended use does not clearly preserve gentleness, truth, safety, consent, and human dignity, you do not have permission to use this work.*

This is not merely legal framing but a pastoral boundary that protects the commons of healing.

## 3.0 Promotion & Engagement Strategy: An Invitation to Rest

### 3.1 A Strategy of Relational Engagement

The Codex is shared not through marketing, but through relational, organic, and trust-based invitation.

### 3.2 Identifying Key Audiences

| Faith & Systems Practitioners | Systems + spiritual integration | Interdisciplinary conferences |

### 3.3 Phased Engagement Tactics

**Phase 1 — Foundational Seeding (Months 1–3)**  
Small circle feedback and resonance testing.

**Phase 2 — Organic Introduction (Months 4–9)**  
Gentle peer sharing and introductory writing.

**Phase 3 — Cultivating the Commons (Months 10+)**  
Moderated shared spaces, Q&A, and stewardship gatherings.

This roadmap is not a launch plan.  
It is a stewardship covenant.

a commons of healing —  
and an invitation to rest.
