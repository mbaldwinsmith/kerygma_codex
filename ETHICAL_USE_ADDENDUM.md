## 2. Prohibited Uses

This work may **not** be used, in whole or in part, in any system, product, programme, institution, or technology that:

• applies spiritual, therapeutic, or wellbeing language to override consent or limits  
• uses spiritual or psychological concepts to pressure behaviour, productivity, or conformity  
• engages in surveillance, emotional extraction, behavioural scoring, or performance optimisation  
• functions as a primary attachment substitute for embodied human relationships  
• manipulates users through fear, shame, dependency, or pseudo-spiritual authority  
• replaces safeguarding, medical care, or therapeutic care with spiritual language  
• enforces spiritual practices, disciplines, or participation  
• weaponises moral, spiritual, or coherence language for control, reputation management, or ideological dominance

• pressure healing timelines  
• bypass embodied, professional, or medical care  
• shame vulnerability  
• demand emotional disclosure  
• spiritualise exhaustion, poverty, or distress  

Where harm, vulnerability, or risk is present, safeguarding and professional care must always take priority.

## 4. Non-Bypass Clause

No use of this work may bypass:

• consent  
• boundaries  
• safeguarding

## 7. Spirit of This Covenant

This work exists to:
