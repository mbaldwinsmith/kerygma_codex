# Contributing to Kerygma Codex

Thank you for contributing. This project is a gentle, safeguarding-first grammar of Christian formation. It is cruciform, trauma-aware, and pastoral in tone. Please read and follow the guidance below.

## Purpose and Tone
- Use analogical language, not mechanistic language.
- The Cross is the criterion: truthful love under pressure.
- Protect consent, rest, safeguarding, and creaturely limits.
- Avoid hype, grandiosity, and pseudo-scientific claims.

## Canonical Sources (Read First)
For orientation, read `INTRODUCTION.md` first.

## Roadmap Alignment (Public Stewardship)
The Codex is shared as a gentle invitation and a commons of healing. When editing public-facing or onboarding materials, align with the roadmap’s non-negotiables:
- Keep tone cruciform, gentle, and non-performative.
- Refuse diagnostic, ranking, or coercive framing.
- Surface safeguarding and consent with clear off-ramps.
- Foreground the CC BY-SA 4.0 license and Ethical Use Addendum for any publication notes.

## Workflow
1. Check `TASKS.md` and choose the highest-priority incomplete task.
2. Draft new terms using `01_TERM_TEMPLATE.md`.
3. Use the formalism in `02_FORMALISM.md` and the vocabulary in `03_GLOSSARY.md`.
4. Apply guardrails from `04_PASTORAL_GUARDRAILS.md`.
5. Ensure all invariants in `06_TESTS_AND_INVARIANTS.md` are met.
6. Update indexes, cross-references, and the glossary as needed.
7. Update `TASKS.md` to reflect completed work.

## File Naming
- Use lowercase, underscore-separated, URL-safe filenames.
- Fundamental Practices must be in `07_fundamental_practices/`.
- Case studies belong in `case_studies/`.

## Required Sections for New Terms
Every new term must include:
- One-Line Definition
- Formal Operator
- Inputs and Outputs
- Layer Effects (use an approved format)
- What It Heals
- What It Can Damage (If Misused)
- What it looks like in practice
- Patristic Resonance
- Fails the Cross If...

## Layer Effects Convention
You must use one of the approved Layer Effects formats. Unqualified up arrows are not allowed. See `01_TERM_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Safeguarding and Trauma-Awareness
- Never pressure spiritual practice.
- Never spiritualize illness, trauma, or exhaustion.
- Never bypass consent, safeguarding, or material needs.
- The strong carry the weak.

## Case Studies
Case studies should be gentle, concrete, and pastoral. A typical structure:
- Situation
- Distortions Pressing In
- Gentle Path (Practices)
- Safeguards
- Signs of Repair
- Fails the Cross If...

## Submitting Changes
- Prefer small, focused changes.
- Explain the intent, not just the edits.
- Preserve the established tone and vocabulary.

If anything increases fear, shame, pressure, or performance anxiety, stop and return to the basics: prayer, care, and safety.
