# Kerygma Codex
## Project Constitution

This Codex formalises Christian spiritual life using systems-science metaphor as a grammar of participation in the Triune God.

This is not mechanistic theology.
Systems language is analogical, pastoral, and cruciform.

---

## Non-Negotiable Invariants

### 1. The Cruciform Criterion
Coherence is measured by:
Truthful love that remains faithful, gentle, and true under pressure.

Any stability that avoids the Cross is not coherence.

---

### 2. Pastoral Circuit Breaker
If use of this Codex increases pressure, shame, fear, or spiritual performance anxiety, stop.
Return to simple prayer, embodied care, and pastoral or therapeutic support.

---

### 3. No Spiritual Bypass
Consent, safeguarding, creaturely limits, and material needs must never be overridden by spiritual language.

---

### 4. Trauma Is Not Spiritual Failure
Illness, trauma, neurodivergence, grief, and depression are not signs of low coherence.

---

### 5. No Diagnosing Others
This Codex is for self-examination, repentance, and communal repair.
It must never be used to label, rank, or dominate others.

---

### 6. Grace Is Gift
Practices dispose the heart; they do not manufacture God.

---

### 7. Analogical Language Only
Never treat God as a mechanism, algorithm, or system object.

---

### 8. Rest Is Holy
Any theology that cannot tolerate Sabbath is not generative.
