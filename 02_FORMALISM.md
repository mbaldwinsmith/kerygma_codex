# Core Formalism

Let the human person be:

H = (G, L, P, A, σ, Φ)

Where:

G — Ground (being, safety, identity)  
L — Logos (meaning, truth, conscience)  
P — Presence (relational attunement)  
A — Attractor topology  
σ — signal-to-noise ratio of divine coherence  
Φ — illumination / wisdom density  

Let ℒ be the Logos generative grammar (Christ-pattern).

Iterative convergence:
xₙ₊₁ = ℒ(xₙ)

Coherence is not comfort.
Coherence is truthful, cruciform love under pressure.
