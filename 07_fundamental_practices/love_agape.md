# Love (Ἀγάπη / caritas)

## One-Line Definition
Agape is self-giving, truthful, and non-coercive love that participates in the life of God and generates coherence in persons and communities.

---

## Formal Operator
Grounded in **Grace** and **Truth** and cruciformly shaped by **Atonement**, agape is a coherence-conductivity operator that reduces relational resistance and increases participation in the Logos grammar.

## Patristic Resonance
- **St Irenaeus** described love as participation in the life of God that restores humanity.

- **St Isaac the Syrian** saw love as mercy that embraces all creation.  
- **St Augustine** spoke of caritas as the form of all virtue.

## Fails the Cross If…
Love is used to avoid truth, erase boundaries, spiritualise harm, demand self-erasure, or maintain unjust systems rather than bearing costly, truthful love in the pattern of Christ.
