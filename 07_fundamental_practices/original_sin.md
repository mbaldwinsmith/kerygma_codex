# Original Sin (Προπατορικὴ Ἁμαρτία / Peccatum Originale)

## One-Line Definition
Original Sin is the inherited deformation of the human coherence landscape under death and fear — a baseline attractor-field distortion rather than personal guilt — while ontological belovedness remains intact.

---

## Formal Operator
Original Sin is a **baseline attractor-field deformation condition** affecting all human systems born into wounded creation.
It names inherited terrain distortion, **not** personal culpability.

Let H = (G, L, P, A, σ, Φ) and let O be the original-sin field condition.

Under O:
- A → Ã (inherited attractor-topology deformation)
- σ ↓ (signal-to-noise ratio thinned by fear and death-pressure)
- Φ ↓ (wisdom density reduced)
- entropy ↑ (relational fragmentation increases)

**Ontological belovedness remains intact:**
Gᵦₑₗₒᵥₑd is **not** damaged or diminished by O.

Original Sin therefore refines the need for:
- **Incarnation** — healing from within the deformed terrain.
- **Grace** — gift-field rescue that precedes effort.
- **Baptism** — initiation into healed convergence and a new field of belonging.
- **Metanoia** — local attractor repair of disordered desire and attention.
- **Sanctification** — slow terrain re-formation over time.

## Inputs
- Human systems born into wounded creation
- Inherited fear, scarcity, and death-pressure
- Communal and cultural distortion patterns
- Relational rupture across generations
- Creaturely limits and embodied vulnerability

---

## Outputs
- A shared predisposition toward misalignment and reactivity
- Increased drag on truthful love under pressure
- Reduced clarity in discernment without grace-held formation
- Heightened relational friction and isolation tendencies
- Ongoing need for healing-from-within and gift-field rescue

## Layer Effects (when named in grace)
| Layer | Δ Effect |
|------|---------|
| Ground (G) | ↑ (belovedness safeguarded and clarified) |
| Logos (L)  | ↑ (truthful naming without inherited-guilt shame) |
| Presence (P) | ↑ (openness to communion and repair) |

## What It Heals
When held in grace, naming Original Sin can heal:
- Inherited-guilt preaching that confuses distortion with identity
- Shame-based anthropology that erases dignity
- Isolation that hides need for healing and communion
- Prideful denial of shared human vulnerability
- Despair narratives that say “this is all there is”

---

## What It Can Damage (If Misused)
- Inherited-guilt doctrines that shame children or the vulnerable
- Shame-based anthropology that collapses dignity
- Despair-inducing doctrines that erase hope of repair
- Abuse-justifying “you deserve this” narratives
- Spiritual bypass that blames trauma or illness on personal failure

**Misuse-prevention notes**
- Original Sin is **not** personal guilt; it is inherited terrain deformation.
- Distortion is separated from identity; belovedness is never under review.
- The Cross forbids abuse: truthful love under pressure protects the vulnerable.
- If the term increases fear, panic, or self-hatred, return to grounding, rest, and pastoral care.
- Consent, safeguarding, and creaturely limits are non-negotiable.

---

## What it looks like in practice
- Teaching that all humans share a wounded landscape **and** an undamaged belovedness.
- Holding confession and repentance as local repairs, not as inherited shame.
- Emphasising Incarnation and Grace as God’s healing from within the terrain.
- Baptismal catechesis that frames initiation as entry into a healed field, not escape from worthlessness.
- Slow, consented formation that honours trauma-aware pacing.

---

## Patristic Resonance
- **St Athanasius**: corruption (φθορά) is healed by the Incarnation’s life from within, not by condemnation.
- **St Irenaeus**: recapitulation restores human nature rather than despising it.
- **St Gregory of Nyssa**: human nature is good and healable in God, not annihilated.
- **St Maximus the Confessor**: disordered desire is re-ordered toward God through grace and participation.

---

## Fails the Cross If…
Original Sin is taught to shame, dehumanise, or justify harm; if it overrides consent or safeguarding; or if it produces despair rather than opening truthful love under pressure to receive healing.

---

## Trauma-aware safeguarding
- Dignity is protected at every step; belovedness is never in question.
- Distortion is named as inherited terrain, not as a personal verdict.
- Those harmed by “total depravity” or inherited-guilt teaching receive explicit pastoral repair: validation of harm, re-anchoring in belovedness, and permission to slow down.
- Trauma, illness, neurodivergence, and grief are never moralised.
- Professional support (therapy, safeguarding, medical care) is honoured and never replaced.
