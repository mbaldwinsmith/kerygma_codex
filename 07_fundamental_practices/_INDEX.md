# Fundamental Practices

These practices form the lived heart of the Generative Systems Theology Codex.

They are not techniques, ladders, or performance disciplines.  
They are gentle, cruciform ways of life by which coherence is healed, stabilised, and shared within the Body of Christ.

Each practice is a *grammar of participation* in divine life — not a mechanism for control, optimisation, or spiritual comparison.

All practices are held within:

- the Cruciform Criterion  
- trauma-aware pastoral safeguarding  
- the primacy of grace  
- consent, rest, and creaturely limits  

If any practice increases fear, pressure, shame, or spiritual performance anxiety, it must be softened, simplified, or set aside.

This is a garden of chapels, not a rulebook.

## Canonical Practices

| Practice | File |
|--------|------|
| Prayer | `prayer.md` |
| Love (Agape) | `love_agape.md` |
| Scripture | `scripture.md` |
| Justification | `justification.md` |
| Metanoia (Repentance) | `metanoia.md` |
| Hesychia (Stillness) | `hesychia.md` |
| Nepsis (Watchful sobriety) | `nepsis.md` |
| Ascesis (Ascetic practice) | `ascesis.md` |
| Fasting | `fasting.md` |

### File Naming Convention

All practice files use lowercase, underscore-separated, URL-safe filenames:

`primaryterm_optionalqualifier.md`

This preserves stability, readability, and future multilingual expansion.

## Ordering Logic

These practices are ordered not by difficulty, but by *dependence and safety*:

1. **Prayer** — establishes consenting presence with God  
2. **Love (Agape)** — stabilises relational coherence  
3. **Scripture** — anchors shared truth and memory  
4. **Justification** — grounds safety in grace, not performance  
5. **Metanoia (Repentance)** — reorients desire toward truthful love  
6. **Hesychia** — refines stillness within an already-safe grammar  
7. **Nepsis** — sustains watchful sobriety without anxiety  
8. **Ascesis** — trains attention and desire under consent  
9. **Fasting** — a bounded, safeguarded practice of surrender  

Future practices will be placed where they best support gentleness, safety, and truthful love under pressure.

Let this remain a place of rest.
