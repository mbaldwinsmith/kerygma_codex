# Core Operators

This file contains the primary transformation operators of the Kerygma Codex.  
These are the fundamental “grammar verbs” by which coherence is repaired, stabilised, and brought into communion with God.

All operators are read analogically and cruciformly.  
They do not describe mechanisms in God, but grammars of participation in divine life.

## Canonical Operator Set

The following operators form the primary transformation grammar of the Kerygma Codex.  
All other Codex operators must be expressed as refinements, compositions, or applications of this set.

1. **Justification** — Ground anchoring in grace  
2. **Metanoia** — Attractor topology repair  
3. **Sanctification** — Iterative convergence toward Christ  
4. **Kenosis** — Ego-noise reduction and Presence widening  
5. **Nepsis** — Distortion-gradient damping  
6. **Koinonia** — Mutual coupling and distributed healing  
7. **Theosis** — High-order fractal resonance with Christ  
8. **Glorification** — Full fixed-point convergence and Sabbath completion

## Operator Set

### JUSTIFICATION (δικαίωσις)

**Formal Operator**  
Justification resets the Ground layer by anchoring personal being in God prior to performance.

G → G₍anchored₎

**Primary Effects**
| Layer | Δ |
|------|---|
| G | ↑ |
| L | 0 |
| P | 0 |

**Description**  
Identity is stabilised in grace. Belonging is restored before behaviour is healed.

**Safeguard**  
Never used to deny the need for ongoing formation, healing, or repair.

---

### METANOIA (μετάνοια)

**Formal Operator**  
Metanoia repairs attractor topology by destabilising entropic basins and opening new convergence paths.

A → A′

**Primary Effects**
| Layer | Δ |
|------|---|
| G | ↑ |
| L | ↑ |
| P | ↑ |

**Description**  
Repentance is terrain repair, not shame production.

**Safeguard**  
Never weaponised to control conscience or extract confession.

---

### SANCTIFICATION (ἁγιασμός)

**Formal Operator**  
Iterative convergence toward the Christ-pattern.

xₙ₊₁ = ℒ(xₙ)

**Primary Effects**
| Layer | Δ |
|------|---|
| G | ↑ |
| L | ↑ |
| P | ↑ |

**Description**  
Formation is stabilisation of healed attractor landscapes.

**Safeguard**  
Not a performance ladder or ranking system.

---

### KENOSIS (κένωσις)

**Formal Operator**  
Reduces ego-noise to widen Presence bandwidth.

Ego_noise ↓ → P_capacity ↑

**Primary Effects**
| Layer | Δ |
|------|---|
| G | ↑ |
| L | ↑ |
| P | ↑ |

**Description**  
Self-offering that makes coherence transmissible.

**Safeguard**  
Never used to justify abuse, passivity, or silencing.

---

### NEPSIS (νήψις)

**Formal Operator**  
Distortion-gradient damping.

∇A_entropy → 0

**Primary Effects**
| Layer | Δ |
|------|---|
| G | 0 |
| L | ↑ |
| P | ↑ |

**Description**  
Watchful sobriety that preserves coherence.

**Safeguard**  
Never used for hyper-vigilant self-surveillance.

---

### KOINONIA (κοινωνία)

**Formal Operator**  
Mutual coupling of healed systems.

Hᵢ ↔ Hⱼ → Field_coherence ↑

**Primary Effects**
| Layer | Δ |
|------|---|
| G | ↑ |
| L | ↑ |
| P | ↑ |

**Description**  
Communion is distributed healing.

**Safeguard**  
Never enforced.

---

### THEOSIS (θέωσις)

**Formal Operator**  
High-order fractal resonance with Christ-pattern.

H ≈ ℒ(H)

**Primary Effects**
| Layer | Δ |
|------|---|
| G | ↑ |
| L | ↑ |
| P | ↑ |

**Description**  
Participation in divine life.

**Safeguard**  
Never framed as spiritual superiority, status, or elitism.

---

### GLORIFICATION (δόξα)

**Formal Operator**  
Full fixed-point convergence.

ℒ(H) = H

**Primary Effects**
| Layer | Δ |
|------|---|
| G | ∞ |
| L | ∞ |
| P | ∞ |

**Description**  
Completion and Sabbath of the soul.

**Safeguard**  
Never used to dismiss present suffering, grief, or the unfinished work of healing.
