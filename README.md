## Welcome

The **Kerygma Codex** is a gentle, safeguarding-first grammar for Christian formation.

It exists to cultivate what it calls a **repair ecology** —  
a living habitat where human beings can become whole, truthful, gentle, and safe under pressure.

This Codex does not offer a programme to run, a ladder to climb, or a system to master.  
It offers a **shared language for healing participation in Christ**.

Before reading further, we invite you to begin with:

- **`INTRODUCTION.md`** - *A gentle overview of the Codex*
- **`MANIFESTO.md`** - *A Manifesto for Generative Systems Theology: The Kerygma Codex*

## What This Is

The Kerygma Codex is a pastoral-theological commons that uses systems-science metaphor as an **analogical translation layer** for ancient Christian formation theology.

Within this grammar:

• salvation is understood as **coherence repair in Christ**  
• formation is participatory, not performative  
• stability is measured by cruciform love, not spiritual output  
• safeguarding is structural, not optional  

The human person is modelled analogically as a layered system:

- **Ground (G)** — being, safety, belonging  
- **Logos (L)** — meaning, conscience, truth  
- **Presence (P)** — relational aliveness and communion  

All coherence is measured by one criterion:

> **Truthful love that remains gentle under pressure — the Cross.**

## What This Is Not

This Codex is not:

- a performance spirituality  
- a behaviour-optimisation tool  
- a self-improvement programme  
- a diagnostic system for other people  
- a mechanism that attempts to “make God act”  

It is a grammar of participation, not control.  
It exists to name healing patterns, not to rank or dominate human beings.
