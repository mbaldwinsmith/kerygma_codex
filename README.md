## Welcome

The **Kerygma Codex** is a gentle, safeguarding-first grammar for Christian formation. It names patterns of healing participation in Christ using systems-science metaphors as a **translation layer**, always subordinate to the Cross and to pastoral truth.

At its heart is a **repair ecology**: a habitat where people can become whole, truthful, gentle, and safe under pressure. This is not a performance system or a ladder to climb; it is a shared language for communion, discernment, and formation.

## What You Will Find Here

- **Christ-centred coherence**: truthful love under pressure is the criterion for all formation.
- **Trauma-aware safeguards**: consent, rest, and creaturely limits are non-negotiable.
- **Analogical systems language**: a careful metaphorical grammar that serves, not replaces, Christian truth.
- **Practical formation resources**: formal operator definitions, fundamental practices, and case studies.

## A Final Word

If your engagement with this work makes you feel smaller, more afraid, or more pressured, pause. Rest. Return to simple prayer and embodied care. The Codex exists to nurture a repair ecology, not a performance culture.
