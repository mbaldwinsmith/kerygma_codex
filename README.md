# generative_systems_theology
Generative Systems Theology formalises Christian soteriology, formation, and ecclesiology using systems-science metaphor. It models the human person as a tri-layer coherence field (Ground, Logos, Presence), treats salvation as attractor repair and convergence toward Christ, and provides a trauma-aware, cruciform theological framework.
