Describe how this operator tends to affect each layer in healthy use, and how it can affect them in misuse mode.

At least one of the three formats below must be used. Unqualified ↑/↑/↑ is not permitted.

Option A — Dual-mode (preferred)
| Layer | Healthy use | Misuse mode |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Ground (G) | ↑ | ↓ |
| Logos (L)  | ↑ | 0 |
| Presence (P) | ↑ | ↓ |

Option B — Mixed baseline
| Ground (G) | ↑ |
| Logos (L)  | 0 |
| Presence (P) | ↑ |


With a short explanatory note below the table.

Option C — Conditional note
| Ground (G) | ↑ |
| Logos (L)  | ↑ |

> ↑ in healthy, consented use; can ↓ if misused (see Misuse-Prevention Notes).


Purpose:
This ensures that every Codex entry explicitly encodes pastoral risk, consent boundaries, and failure modes within the formal systems grammar itself.

Distortions repaired.

### What It Can Damage (If Misused)
Misuse pathways.

### What it looks like in practice
Gentle real-world pastoral usage.
