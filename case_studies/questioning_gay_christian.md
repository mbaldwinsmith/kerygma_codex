# Case Study: The Questioning Gay Christian

## Situation
A Christian is asking honest questions about sexuality, belonging, and faith. They fear rejection, coercion, or being used as a debate topic.

## Distortions Pressing In
- Conscience is overridden by pressure.
- Belonging is made conditional.
- Silence is treated as holiness.

## Gentle Path (Practices)
- **Grace** and **Justification**: belonging before answers.
- **Conscience** and **Discernment**: space for truth-seeking.
- **Truth** and **Mercy**: honest naming without shame.
- **Spiritual Direction**: companioned, consented guidance.
- **Koinonia**: community that protects dignity and safety.

## Safeguards
- Consent governs pace and scope of conversation.
- No coercive outcomes or forced disclosures.
- Non-retaliation for honest questions.
- Pastoral care does not replace professional support.

## Signs of Repair
- Questions can be voiced without fear.
- Identity is not collapsed into a single issue.
- Trust grows in small, safe steps.

## Fails the Cross If...
- The person is pressured into silence or conformity.
- Belonging is used as leverage.
- Harm is minimized to protect reputation.
