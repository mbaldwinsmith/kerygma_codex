# Case Study: The Religiously Traumatised Believer

## Situation
A believer carries fear and confusion from harmful church experiences. Scripture and prayer trigger anxiety.

## Distortions Pressing In
- God is confused with control and coercion.
- Truth feels unsafe.
- Community is associated with threat.

## Gentle Path (Practices)
- **Grace** and **Mercy**: protection before exposure.
- **Peace**: stabilize fear and hypervigilance.
- **Truth** with **Lament**: name harm without shame.
- **Spiritual Direction**: companioned, consented discernment.
- **Koinonia**: slow, safe reconnection to community.

## Safeguards
- Consent governs pace; no forced disclosure.
- Exit rights are explicit and protected.
- Professional care is welcomed and respected.
- Safeguarding policies are non-negotiable.

## Signs of Repair
- Triggers soften; prayer becomes possible again.
- Truth can be named without collapse.
- Trust grows in small, consented steps.

## Fails the Cross If...
- The person is pressured back into unsafe spaces.
- Harm is minimized in the name of unity.
- "Forgive and forget" replaces protection and truth.
