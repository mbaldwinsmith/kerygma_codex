# Case Study: The Exhausted Pastor

## Situation
A pastor is depleted by constant care, conflict, and expectations. They feel responsible for everyone and ashamed to rest.

## Distortions Pressing In
- Ministry is equated with self-erasure.
- Success is measured by visibility and growth.
- Vulnerability feels dangerous.

## Gentle Path (Practices)
- **Grace** and **Justification**: identity before role.
- **Peace**: restore safety and reduce pressure.
- **Sabbath** and **Waiting**: paced recovery without guilt.
- **Lament**: honest grief before God.
- **Spiritual Direction**: safe, non-coercive accompaniment.

## Safeguards
- Clear boundaries and time off are protected.
- External accountability and care are welcomed.
- The community shares the load; no heroics.
- Professional support is normalized.

## Signs of Repair
- Rest is possible without shame.
- Leadership becomes gentler and less reactive.
- The pastor can receive care as well as give it.

## Fails the Cross If...
- The pastor is pressured to perform or hide weakness.
- Growth is prioritized over safety.
- Rest is treated as disloyalty.
