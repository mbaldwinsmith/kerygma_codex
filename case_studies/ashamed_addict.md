# Case Study: The Ashamed Addict

## Situation
A person trapped in addiction carries deep shame and fear of exposure. They expect rejection if they tell the truth.

## Distortions Pressing In
- Identity collapsed into failure.
- Secrecy to avoid rejection.
- Urgency that bypasses safe pacing.

## Gentle Path (Practices)
- **Grace** and **Justification**: belonging before behavior change.
- **Confession**: consented truth-telling without coercion.
- **Truth** and **Mercy**: name harm without humiliation.
- **Hope**: long-arc healing without despair.
- **Koinonia**: safe, accountable community support.

## Safeguards
- No public disclosure; privacy is protected.
- Professional treatment and recovery support are encouraged.
- Relapse is met with care, not shame.
- Accountability is consented and bounded.

## Signs of Repair
- Shame loosens and honesty grows.
- Support replaces isolation.
- Small steps are sustained over time.

## Fails the Cross If...
- Confession is forced or weaponized.
- Shame is used to motivate change.
- Recovery is framed as moral superiority.
