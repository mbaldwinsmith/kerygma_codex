# Case Study: The Burned-Out Carer

## Situation
A carer has spent years supporting a family member with complex needs. They feel exhausted, numb, and guilty for needing rest.

## Distortions Pressing In
- Worth is tied to output and endless availability.
- Rest feels like betrayal.
- Prayer has become performance.

## Gentle Path (Practices)
- **Grace** and **Justification**: belonging before performance.
- **Peace**: stabilize nervous system and reduce shame-noise.
- **Lament**: name grief and loss without bypass.
- **Waiting**: allow time for recovery without shame.
- **Koinonia**: share burden with safe community.

## Safeguards
- Consent to step back is honored; no guilt pressure.
- Professional support and respite care are welcomed.
- Boundaries are named and protected.
- Any pressure to "keep going" is refused.

## Signs of Repair
- Rest no longer feels like failure.
- Capacity returns slowly, without panic.
- Prayer becomes honest, not performative.
- Support is shared rather than hidden.

## Fails the Cross If...
- The carer is told that exhaustion is unfaithfulness.
- Rest is denied or framed as selfishness.
- Care is demanded without support or safety.
