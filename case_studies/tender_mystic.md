# Case Study: The Tender Mystic

## Situation
A person is drawn to deep prayer and silence but is sensitive to spiritual pressure and easily overwhelmed by intense expectations.

## Distortions Pressing In
- Intensity is confused with holiness.
- Self-care is mistaken for lack of devotion.
- Isolation is romanticized.

## Gentle Path (Practices)
- **Prayer** and **Hesychia**: consenting presence, not performance.
- **Grace**: gift before effort.
- **Peace**: protect nervous system limits.
- **Discernment**: test inner movements with humility.
- **Spiritual Direction**: companioned guidance without control.

## Safeguards
- Rest and limits are honored as holy.
- Practices are scaled to capacity, not idealized.
- Community is welcomed without coercion.
- Medical and therapeutic support are affirmed when needed.

## Signs of Repair
- Prayer deepens without collapse.
- Sensitivity is held as gift, not burden.
- Silence is peaceful, not isolating.

## Fails the Cross If...
- The mystic is pushed into unsafe intensity.
- Solitude is demanded as proof of holiness.
- Weakness is treated as spiritual failure.
